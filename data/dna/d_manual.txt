  Analysis options

       Usage:   anaquin <command> [options]

       Command: rna    data-analysis for RNA samples
                dna    data-analysis for DNA samples
                meta   data-analysis for metagenomics samples

  DNA options
  
        Usage: anaquin dna <arguments> <sequins-file> <input-file>
  
        -l
              Print the DNA standards

        -o <directory>
              All output files will be saved in the directory. If not provided the default will be the
              current working directory.
        
        -se   --sequencing
              Sequecning performance including systematic sequencing errors and quality. Requires SAM/BAM
              input file generated by programs such as BWA etc.
        
        -al  --align
              Alignment performance. Requires SAM or BAM input file generated by programs such as BowTie.

        -va  --variant
              Assess identification and quantification of variants performance. Requires VCF input file
              generated by programs such as GATK etc.

        -o <directory>
              All output files will be saved in the directory. If not provided the default will be name of
              the input-file.
              
        -p   --num-threads
              Use this many threads for processing. The default is 1.

        -r   —-restrict <file> 
              Restrict analysis to sequeins specified in test file with list (one per line) of identifiers
              to be analysed. Please note that identifiers in text file must match identifiers in
              <sequins.(gtf/bed)>.

        —-min <FOLD>
              Analyse sequins only with mean fold-coverage higher than this value. Can be used with --max
              to specific range of expression values.

        —-max <FPKM>
              Analyse seqions only with mean fold-coverage lower than this value. Can be used with --min
              to specific range of expression values.

        —-detected
              Analyse only sequins detected. This will ignore sequins not detected in alignment file from analysis.


        Input files
        -----------

          .SAM/.BAM       A file of RNA-Seq read alignments in the SAM alignments format, or a binary SAM (BAM) file as input.                        For more details on the SAM format, see the specification (http://samtools.github.io/).

          sequins (.VCF)  Reference file of genetic variation on the in silico chromosome in the VCF format. Variant coordinates
                          can be downloaded from http://anaquin.github.io/). 

          .VCF
                          A file of variants in VCF format identified from alignment files (aligned_reads.(sam/bam)). This take files                         from variant identification programs such as GATK etc.
