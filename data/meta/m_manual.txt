  General options
 
       -t
              Execute a series of internal tests and reports for any inconsistency.

       -h

       -v
              Display version information.

       -d  –-verbose
              Print status updates and diagnostic information.


  Analysis options

       Usage:   anaquin <command> [options]

       Command: rna    data-analysis for RNA samples
                dna    data-analysis for DNA samples
                meta   data-analysis for metagenomics samples

  Metageomics options

        Usage: anaquin rna <arguments> <sequins-file> <input-file>

        -l
              Print the metageomics standards

        -se   --sequencing
              Sequecning performance including systematic sequencing errors and quality. Requires SAM/BAM
              input file generated by programs such as BWA etc.
        
        -as  --assembly
              Assesses the de-novo assembly of meta sequins. Requires FASTA input files generated by programs
              such as ABySS, Velvet, Ray Meta etc.

        -o <directory>
              All output files will be saved in the directory. If not provided the default will be name of
              the input-file.
              
        -p   --num-threads
              Use this many threads for processing. The default is 1.

        -r   —-restrict <file> 
              Restrict analysis to sequeins specified in test file with list (one per line) of identifiers to
              be analysed.
              Please note that identifiers in text file must match identifiers in <sequins.(gtf/bed)>.   


        Input files
        -----------

          Sequins (.FA)   Reference file of metasequin sequences in FASTA format. Sequin sequences format can be downloaded from                          http://anaquin.github.io/. 

          .SAM/.BAM       A file of RNA-Seq read alignments in the SAM alignments format, or a binary SAM (BAM) file as input.                        For more details on the SAM format, see the specification (http://samtools.github.io/). This file is
                          typically generated from the alignment of sequenced reads to reference microbe genomes and
                          accompanying metasequin sequences.

          De-Novo (.FA)  File of contain sequences in FASTA format from de novo assembly of sequenced reads. This is compatible with                         contain assemblies from  ABySS, Velvet etc.
