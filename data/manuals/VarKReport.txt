<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
     VarKReport - Assess spliced-read alignments to the in silico chromosome

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    RnaAlign can be used to assess the alignment of sequins-derived reads to the in silico chromosome and calculates
    several useful statistics to describe alignment performance, including:
    a) Dilution indicates fraction of reads that align to the in silico chromosome, relative to the accompanying genome. 
    b) Sensitivity indicates the fraction of annotated regions covered by alignments. 
    c) Precision indicates the accuracy of alignments.
    These statistics are calculated at a nucleotide, exon and intron level. 

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Spliced-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file. Common examples include TopHat2 and STAR.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin RnaAlign –rbed reference.bed –ufiles aligned.bam

<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b>
     The runtime is linearly proportional to the number of alignments in the input file, with long run times expected for
     large alignment files.

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rgtf        Reference transcriptome annotation file in GTF format
        -ufiles      User-generated alignment files in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     RnaAlign_summary.stats - provides statistics to describe to describe the global alignment profile
     RnaAlign_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each individual sequin gene
