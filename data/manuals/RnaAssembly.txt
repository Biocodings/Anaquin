<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
     <b>RnaAssembly - Compares the spliced isoform assemblies to known synthetic gene annotations in the in silico chromosome.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     RnaAssembly assess performance of transcript assembly by compare spliced isoform assemblies to reference synthetic gene
     annotations in the in silico chromosome. Quantitative statistics to describe comparison are provided at exon, intron,   
     intron-chain, transcript and nucleotide level as previously described by Trapnel et al., 2010. 

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Any software that assembles transcript models from alignments, with common examples including Cufflinks
     and StringTie. Assembled transcript models must be provided to Anaquin in GTF file format.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin RnaAssembly –rgtf reference.gtf -m mixture.csv –ufiles transcripts.gtf

<b>TOOL OPPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rgtf      Reference annotation file in GTF format.
        -m         Reference miture file in CSV format.
        -ufiles    User-generated transcriptome in GTF format.

     Optional:
        -o = output Directory in which the output files are written to.

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
    RnaAssembly_summary.stats - provides summary statistics to describe global transcript assembly
    RnaAsssembly_sequins.csv  - provides statistics for assembly of each individual sequin isoform
    RnaAssembly_assembly.R    - provides R-script for plotting non-linear model between sensitivity (dependent variable)
                                and input concentration (independent variable). This plot is useful for visualizing the
                                expression dependent bias and assembly limit for a library

<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b>
    RnaAssembly embeds the CuffDiff (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks) software for quantifying a
    transcriptome GTF file. For additional detail on the definition and method for comparing transcript models,
