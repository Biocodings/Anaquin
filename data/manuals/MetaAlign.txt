<b>NAME</b>
    MetaAlign - Measures the read alignment from sequins to the in silico community.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    MetaAlign calculates several useful statistics to describe alignment performance, including:
    a) Dilution factor indicates fraction of reads that align to the in silico community, relative to the accompanying  genome. 
    b) Sensitivity indicates the fraction of annotated regions covered by alignments. 
    c) Precision indicates the accuracy of alignments.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Short-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file, including popular examples such as BWA and Bowtie.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin MetaAlign -m mixture.csv -ufiles align.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -m           Reference MetaQuin mixture file in CSV format
        -ufiles      Generated alignment file for microbes and sequins in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     MetaAlign_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     MetaAlign_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
