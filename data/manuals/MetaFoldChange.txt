<b>NAME</b>
    MetaFoldChange - Assess fold-change in abundance between multiple samples.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    MetaFoldChange can be used to analyse the differential fold-change of sequins between different mixtures
    that have been alternately spiked-in to multiple samples. 

   The differential abundance of sequins is emulated by modulating the relative concentration of sequins between
   alternative mixtures (such as between Mixture A and B) and provides a known reference scale of differential
   expression between samples. This scale can be used to assess the measurement of fold-changes in specie abundance
   between libraries.
   
   Specifically, MetaFoldChange builds a linear model regressing the measured log-fold (dependent variable) to the
   input concentration (independent variable) defined by a mixture. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to
   estimate the regression parameters. 

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    MetaFoldChange is compatible with short-read aligners, including: BWA and Bowtie. In addition, the tool can be
    used in R for data visualization. Furthermore, the tool can be used for quantifying k-mer abundance. The current
    release supports RayMeta, future releases will add new softwares. Users of alternative software may need to modify
    their results to conform with file formats produced by these popular software tools, before provision to the tool.
 
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
    Measure fold-change by alignment:

        anaquin MetaFoldChange –m mixture.csv –ufiles A.bam –ufiles B.bam

    Measure fold-change by de novo assembly:
    
        anaquin MetaFoldChange –m mixture.csv –ufiles A.tsv –ufiles A.psl –ufiles B.tsv –ufiles B.psl

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -m           Reference MetaQuin mixture file in CSV format
        -ufiles      The tool supports quantification by alignment or de novo assembly. The usage example describes
                     the two scenarios. 

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     MetaFold_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     MetaFold_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
