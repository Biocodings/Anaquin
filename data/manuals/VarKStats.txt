<b>NAME</b>
    VarKmer - Quantitative k-mer analysis for sequins.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     VarKmer can be used for analyzing common statistics such as dilution and allele frequency without read alignments,
     useful for quick troubleshooting.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarKmer -usequin seq.1.fq -usequin seq.2.fq

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -usequin                Generated Kallisto quantification file

     Optional:
        -o = output             Directory in which output files are written to
        -rmix                   Reference mixture for sequin allele frequency in TSV format
        -rind                   Reference sequin index in FASTA format
        -threads = 1            Number of threads

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarKmer_summary.stats    - provides summary statistics for sequin abundance
     VarKmer_sequins.tsv      - provides detailed statistics on the revese and forward genome for each sequin
     VarKmer_kmers.tsv        - provides detailed statistics for each measured reference k-mer
     VarKmer_allele.tsv       - provides detailed statistics for the cancer allele frequency ladder
     VarKmer_allele.R         - provides R-script for plotting a linear model between measured allele frequency (dependent variable)
                                and expected allele frequency (independent variable) on the logarithm scale
