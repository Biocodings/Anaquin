<b>NAME</b>
     VarDiscover - Assess the identification of variants on the in silico genome

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarDiscover is used to assess the identification and quantification of synthetic variation on the in silico
    genome. VarDiscover provides several useful statistics to describe the variant identification (sensitivity,
    precision etc) and quantification (correlation, slope etc.). 
    VarDiscover also generates scripts to plot variant quantification in R, which can be used to assess diagnostic
    performance (including ROC curve and AUC statistics).

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    VarDiscover requires standard VCF files that is generated by common variant calling software, such as Genome Analysis
    Toolkit (GATK). Non-supported variant file formats can be converted to VarQuin Variant Format (.txt). Please see
    user-guide for details. 

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarDiscover –rbed reference.bed –rvcf reference.vcf –m mixture.csv –ufiles variants.vcf

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rvcf        Reference variant annotation file in VCF format
        -rbed        Reference coordinate annotation file in BED format
        -m           Reference VarQuin mixture file in CSV format
        -ufiles      User-generated variants in VCF format or VarDiscover format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
    VarDiscover_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
    VarDiscover_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
    VarDiscover_detected.csv  - gives detailed statistics for detected variants
    VarDiscover_ROC.R         – R script that plots a ROC curve and report AUC statistics
    VarDiscover_LOD.R         - R script that plots limit-of-detection (LOD) curve. Only generated if p-values are
                                provided by user
    VarDiscover_allele.R      - R script that plots linear model relating the measured allele frequency (dependent variable)
                                to the expected allele frequency (independent variable) defined by mixture file
