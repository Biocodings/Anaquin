<b>NAME</b>
    VarKReport - Create PDF report with VarQuin sequins by k-mer quantification

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    This tool quantifies allele frequency for the sequins. It builds a linear model between input concentration and measured
    allele frequency. The allele frequency is measured by the k-mer counts generated by Salmon.

    Although k-mer quantification is typically quicker than alignments, without alignment positions this tool is unable to
    generate variant calling diagnostic statistics.
    
    The output is a PDF file with statistics and plot for the allele frequency analysis.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    The tool requires trimmed paired-end sequence files.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
    anaquin VarKReport –rind salmon.index –m mixture.csv –ufiles experiment.txt

<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b>
     The tool requires prerequisites be installed. Please consult <b>Section 7</b> in the user guide for details.
