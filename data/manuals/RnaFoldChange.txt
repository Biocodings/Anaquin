NAME
	 RnaFoldChange - Assess fold-changes in gene expression between multiple samples

DESCRIPTION
	 RnaFoldChange can be used to analyse the differential expression of sequins between different mixtures that have been alternately spiked-in to multiple samples.

	 The differential expression of sequins is emulated by modulating the relative concentration of sequins between alternative mixtures (such as between Mixture A and B)
	 and provides a known reference scale of differential expression between samples. This scale can be used to assess the measurement of fold-changes in gene expression 
	 between RNA-Seq libraries, and estimate diagnostic power and confidence limits.

	 Specifically, RnaFoldChange builds a linear model regressing the measured log-fold (dependent variable; provided by third party tool such as Cufflinks) to the input 
	 concentration (independent variable) defined by a mixture. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to estimate the regression parameters. 

	 RnaFoldChange can also be used to assess the diagnostic performance for detecting sequin fold-change between mixtures with receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
	 curves, area under the curve (AUC) statistics and limit of detection of ratio (LODR) estimates.

BIOINFORMATICS SOFTWARE
	RnaFoldChange is compatible with many popular gene expression tools, including: Cuffcompare. In addition, RnaFoldChange can be used in R and is compatible with
	edgeR, DESeq2. Users of alternative software may need to modify their results to conform with file formats produced by these popular software tools, before provision
	to RnaExpression.

INPUTS
	 Reference RnaQuin mixture in CSV format (must have two columns, for input concentration defined for mixture A and B respectively)
	 Generated differential analysis file in text format
	 
USAGE EXAMPLE
	 anaquin RnaFoldChange –rgtf reference.gtf –m mixture.csv –ufiles diff.txt
