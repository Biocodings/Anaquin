<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
     RnaFoldChange - Assess fold-changes in sequin expression between multiple samples.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    RnaFoldChange can be used to analyse the differential expression of sequins between different mixtures
    that have been alternately added to multiple samples. 

    The differential expression of sequins is emulated by modulating the relative concentration of sequins
    and provides a known reference scale of differential expression between samples. This scale can be used
    to assess the measurement of fold-changes in gene expression between RNA-Seq libraries, and estimate diagnostic
    power and confidence limits.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    RnaFoldChange is compatible with many common tools for analysing differential gene expression, including Cufflinks,
    and Sleuth. In addition, RnaExpression can be used in R and is compatible with edgeR, DESeq2. Users of
    alternative software may need to modify their results to conform with file formats produced by these common
    software tools.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin RnaFoldChange –rmix reference.csv -method gene –usequin diff.txt
