       <tool>
            Execute the following data analysis tool:
            
            RnaAlign      - Measure the spliced read alignments from sequins to the in silico chromosome
            RnaAssembly   - Compare assembled transcript models to sequin annotations in the in silico chromosome
            RnaExpression - Quantitative analysis of sequin expression
            RnaFoldChange - Assess fold-changes in gene expression between multiple samples
            RnaSubsample  - Calibrate the sequence coverage of sequins across multiple replicates

            VarAlign      - Assess the alignment of sample- and sequin derived reads to sequin regions
            VarFlip       - Flips sequin-derived reads from chiral (3’ to 5’) to human genome .(5’ to 3’) orientation
            VarKmer       - Quantitative k-mer analysis for sequin allele frequnecy
            VarCalibrate  - Calibrate sequin- and sample-derived alignment coverage
            VarGermline   - Compare the identification of germline variants from sequin- and sample-derived alignments
            VarCopy       - Perform quantitative analysis on copy number variation
            VarStructure  - Compare the identification of structural variants from sequin- and sample-derived alignments
            VarSomatic    - Compare the identification of somatic variants from sequin- and sample-derived alignments

            MetaAbund     - Quantitative analysis of sequin abundance
            MetaAssembly  - Compares assembled contigs to sequin annotations in the in silico community
