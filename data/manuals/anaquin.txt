       <tool>
            Execute the following data analysis tool:
            
            RnaAlign      - Measure the spliced read alignments from sequins to the in silico chromosome
            RnaAssembly   - Compare assembled transcript models to sequin annotations in the in silico chromosome
            RnaExpression - Quantitative analysis of sequin expression
            RnaFoldChange - Assess fold-changes in gene expression between multiple samples
            RnaSubsample  - Calibrate the sequence coverage of sequins across multiple replicates

            VarAlign      - Measures the read alignment from sequins to the in silico chromosome
            VarFlip       - Compute reverse complement of sequin alignments to the reverse genome
            VarDiscover   - Assess the identification of variants on the in silico chromosome
            VarSubsample  - Calibrate sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying human genome
