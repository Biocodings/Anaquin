<b>NAME</b>
     VarSubsample - Calibrate sequin- and sample-derived alignment coverage.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     Alignment subsampling is a simple and effective method for calibrating the sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying human genome sample. This tool calculates the alignment coverage within specified regions, and scales sequin coverage in corresponding regions accordingly.   

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Users are required to provide alignment file (SAM/BAM) generated by short-read aligner, such as Bowtie and BWA.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarSubsample –rbed reference.bed –meth mean –usample sample.bam -usequin sequins.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rbed           Annotation file (BED format) of sequin regions used for subsampling
        -usample        Generated alignment file for sample-derived reads in SAM/BAM format
        -usequin        Generated alignment file for sequin-derived reads in SAM/BAM format 

     Optional:
        -method = mean  Algorithm used to calculate sequence coverage. Possible values include mean, median, reads,
                        x (where x is the fraction of reads aligned to <i>in silico</i> to subsample. For example, 0.01 is 1%, 0.10
                        is 10% etc.)
        -o = output     Directory in which the output files are written to
        -edge = 0       Egde effects width in nucleotide bases

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     Subsampled alignments are directly written to the console. Users are recommended to pipe outputs to a new file. For
     example, the following command pipes the outputs to the BAM format:
        
          anaquin VarSubample -rbed reference.bed -meth mean -usample sample.bam -usequin sequins.bam | samtools view -bS - > aligned.bam
        
     VarSubsample_summary.stats - provides summary statistics
     VarSubsample_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each squin
