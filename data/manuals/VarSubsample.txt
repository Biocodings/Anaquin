NAME
	 VarSubsample - Subsample an alignment file to match with the genome.

DESCRIPTION
	Alignment subsampling is a simple and effective method for calibrating the sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying diploid human genome.

BIOINFORMATICS SOFTWARE
	 Short-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM file, including Bowtie and BWA.

INPUTS
	 Reference annotation file in BED format
	 Reference VarQuin mixture in CSV format
	 Generated alignment file in SAM/BAM format
	 
USAGE EXAMPLE
	 anaquin VarSubsample –rbed reference.bed –ufiles aligned.bam

TOOL OPTIONS
	 Required:
	 	-rbed        Reference VarQuin annotation file in BED format
		-ufiles      Generated alignment files in SAM/BAM format

	 Optional:
		-o = output	 Directory in which the output files are written to

OUTPUTS
	 VarSubsample_summary.stats gives the summary statistics. Field definitions:

	 	Reference regions			Reference region annotation in BED format 
		User alignment file   		User generated sample alignments in SAM/BAM format
		Genomic regions				Number of genomic regions in the reference annotation file
		Synthetic regions			Number of synthetic regions in the reference annotation file
		Genome 						Number of alignments on the human genome before and after subsampling
		Synthetic					Number of alignments on the in-silico genome before and after subsampling
		Method						Method used in subsampling
		Genome coverage				Genomic coverage before and after subsampling
		Synthetic coverage			In-silico coverage before and after subsampling

	VarSubsample_sampled.sam is the subsampled output alignment file in SAM format.

	VarSubsample_before.bedgraph gives the base coverage for the in-silico genome before subsampling .

	VarSubsample_after.bedgraph gives the base coverage for the in-silico genome after subsampling.
