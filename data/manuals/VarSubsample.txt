<b>NAME</b>
     VarSubsample - Calibrate sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying human genome

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     Alignment subsampling is a simple and effective method for calibrating the sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying
     diploid human genome. This tool calculates the sequence coverage for the genomic regions and use that to perform
     calibration on the reads aligned to the reverse genome.    

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Users are required to provide alignment file (SAM/BAM) generated by short-read aligner, such as Bowtie and BWA.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarSubsample –rbed reference.bed –meth mean –ufiles sample.bam -ufiles sequins.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rbed           Annotation file (BED format) of mirror regions used for sub-sampling.
        -method = mean  Algorithm used to calculate sequence coverage. Possible values include mean, median, reads,
                        x (where x is the fraction of reads aligned to chrIS to subsample. For example, 0.01 is 1%, 0.10
                        is 10% etc.)
        -ufiles         Generated alignments for the sample in SAM/BAM format
        -ufiles         Generated alignments for sequins in SAM/BAM format      

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     Subsampled alignments are directly written to the console. Users are recommended to pipe outputs to a new file. For
     example, the following command pipes the outputs to the BAM format:
        
         anaquin VarSubample -rbed reference.bed -meth mean -ufiles aligned.bam | samtools view -bS - > aligned.bam
