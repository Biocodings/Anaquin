<b>NAME</b>
     VarSubsample - Calibrate sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying human genome

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     Alignment subsampling is a simple and effective method for calibrating the sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying
     diploid human genome. This tool calculates the sequence coverage for the genomic regions and use that to perform
     calibration on the reads aligned to the <i>in silico</i> genome.    

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Users are required to provide alignment file (SAM/BAM) generated by short-read aligner, such as Bowtie and BWA.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarSubsample –rbed reference.bed –meth mean –uhuman humans.bam -useqs sequins.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rbed           Annotation file (BED format) of mirror regions used for sub-sampling.
        -method = mean  Algorithm used to calculate sequence coverage. Possible values include mean, median, reads,
                        x (where x is the fraction of reads aligned to <i>in silico</i> to subsample. For example, 0.01 is 1%, 0.10
                        is 10% etc.)
        -uhuman         Generated alignments for human genome in SAM/BAM format
        -useqs          Generated alignments for sequins in SAM/BAM format 

     Optional:
        -o = output     Directory in which the output files are written to
        -edge = 0       Egde effects width in nucleotide bases
        -trim = none    How to trim artificials reads aligned to the sequin boundaries. Possible values include none and leftRight.

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     Subsampled alignments are directly written to the console. Users are recommended to pipe outputs to a new file. For
     example, the following command pipes the outputs to the BAM format:
