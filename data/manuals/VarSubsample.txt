NAME
     VarSubsample - Calibrate sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying human genome

DESCRIPTION
    Alignment subsampling is a simple and effective method for calibrating the sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying
    diploid human genome. This tool calculates the sequence coverage for the genomic regions and use that to perform
    calibration on the reads aligned to the in silico chromosome.

BIOINFORMATICS SOFTWARE
     Short-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM file, including Bowtie and BWA.

INPUTS
     Reference annotation file in BED format
     Generated alignment file in SAM/BAM format
     
USAGE EXAMPLE
     anaquin VarSubsample –rbed reference.bed –meth mean –ufiles aligned.bam

TOOL OPTIONS
     Required:
        -rbed           Reference VarQuin annotation file in BED format
        -method = mean  Algorithm used for subsampling. Possible values include mean, median, raw, x.
                          mean    sequencing coverage calculated by taking arithmetic average.
                          median  sequencing coverage calculated by taking median.
                          reads   sequencing coverage calculated by number of reads
                          x       where x is the fraction of reads aligned to chrIS to subsample. For example,
                                  0.01 is 1%, 0.10 is 10% etc.      
        -ufiles      Generated alignment files in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to
