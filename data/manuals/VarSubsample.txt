<b>NAME</b>
     VarSubsample - Calibrate sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying human genome

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    Alignment subsampling is a simple and effective method for calibrating the sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying
    diploid human genome. This tool calculates the sequence coverage for the genomic regions and subsamples alignments to the
    in silico chromosome to calibrate sequence coverage.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Users are required to provide alignment file (SAM/BAM) generated by short-read aligner, such as Bowtie and BWA.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarSubsample –rbed reference.bed –meth mean –ufiles aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rbed           Annotation file (BED format) of human and in silico genome regions used for sub-sampling.  
        -method = mean  Algorithm used to calculate sequence coverage. Possible values include mean, median, reads,
                        x (where x is the fraction of reads aligned to chrIS to subsample. For example, 0.01 is 1%, 0.10
                        is 10% etc.)
        -ufiles         User-generated alignment files in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     Subsampled alignments are directly written to the console. Users are recommended to pipe outputs to a new file. For
     example, the following command pipes the outputs to the BAM format:
