<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
     RnaSubsample - Calibrate the sequence coverage of RNA sequins across multiple replicates.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     RnaSubsample calibrates of sequin coverage across multiple RNA-Seq replicates. The tool is useful to ensure
     the sequencing depth comparable across different libraries, even when varying amounts of RNA sequins have been spiked-in
     to replicates or samples. RnaSubsample requires users to specify preferred dilution fraction, typically, we recommend
     between 1% to 10%.  

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Spliced-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file. Common examples include TopHat2 and STAR.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin RnaSubsample -method 0.01 –ufiles alignment.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -method      Dilution fraction as a floating number. For example, 0.01 is 1% and 0.10 is 10% etc.
        -ufiles      User-generated SAM/BAM alignment file

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     <b>IMPORTANT</b> - Subsampled alignments are directly written to the console. Users are recommended to pipe outputs to
     a new file. For example, the following command pipes the outputs to the BAM format:
        
     anaquin RnaSubample anaquin RnaSubsample -method 0.01 –ufiles alignment.bam | samtools view -bS - > aligned.bam
        
     RnaSubsample_summary.stats - reports summary statistics
