NAME
     RnaAlign -- Measure the spliced read alignments from sequins to the in silico chromosome

DESCRIPTION
     RnaAlign calculates several useful statistics from an alignment file, including:

       Dilution – Fraction of reads that align to the in silico chromosome relative to the accompanying reference genome. 

       Sensitivity - Fraction of annotated nucleotides, exons or introns that are detected by the alignments.
                     For example, if 7 of 10 introns in a gene loci are detected, sensitivity equals 0.7.

       Precision – The fraction of correctly detected nucleotides or introns relative to the total nucleotides or introns.
                   This indicates the accuracy of alignments. For example, if 10 introns are identified in an experiment,
                   but 4 are erroneous, precision equals 0.6.

       These statistics are calculated at a nucleotide, exon and intron level. A further description of diagnostic
       statistics statistics is provided in the Anaquin user guide.

BIOINFORMATICS SOFTWARE
     Spliced-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file. Common examples include TopHat2 and STAR.

INPUTS
     Reference transcriptome annotation file in GTF format
     Generated alignment file in SAM/BAM format

USAGE EXAMPLE
     anaquin RnaAlign –rbed reference.bed –ufiles aligned.bam

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
     The runtime is linearly proportional to the number of reads in the input file, with long run times expected for
     large alignment files.

TOOL OPTIONS
     Required:
        -rgtf        Reference transcriptome annotation file in GTF format
        -ufiles      Generated alignment files in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to
