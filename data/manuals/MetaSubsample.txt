<b>NAME</b>
    MetaSubsample - Calibrate sequence coverage of sequins across multiple replicates

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    MetaSubsample calibrates sequin coverage across multiple metagenomics replicates. The tool
    is useful to ensure the sequencing depth comparable across different libraries, even when
    varying amounts of sequins have been spiked-in to replicates or samples.

    MetaSubsample requires users to specify a preferred dilution fraction (we typically recommend
    between 1% to 10%). The tool then titrates the alignments to the in silico community relative
    to the alignments to the genome according to the user-determine dilution fraction.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Short-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file, including popular examples such as BWA and Bowtie.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin MetaSubsample -method 0.01 -usequin aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -method      Dilution fraction as fraction number. For example, 0.01 is 1% and 0.10 is 10% etc.
        -usequin     User generated SAM/BAM alignment file

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     MetaSubsample_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
