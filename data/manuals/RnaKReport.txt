<b>NAME</b>
     RnaKReport - Create PDF report with RnaQuin sequins by k-mer quantification

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    Kallisto is a popular k-mer quantification tool specifically designed for RNA-Seq. We can use it to
    build k-mer index for sequins, which will allow us to quantify an RNA-Seq experiment without alignments.
    K-mer quantification is much quicker than read alignments.

    This tool uses Kallisto to quantify sequin expression. It builds a linear model between
    the input concentration and transcripts per million. The output is a PDF file with statistics and plots for gene
    and isoform expression analysis. The statistics include correlation, coefficient of determination and regression
    coefficients.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     The tool requires trimmed paired-end RNA-Seq sequence files.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin RnaKReport –rind kallisto.index –m mixture.csv –ufiles experiment.txt

<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b>
     The tool requires prerequisites be installed. Please consult <b>Section 7</b> in the user guide for details.
