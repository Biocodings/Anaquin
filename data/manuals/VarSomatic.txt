<b>NAME</b>
    VarSomatic - Assess the identification of variants from alignments to the <i>in silico</i> genome

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarSomatic can be used for analyzing the identification of variants in cancer normal and tumor samples on
    the chiral genome, and provides several useful statistics to describe the identification of variants,
    including:
    
    <b>Sensitivity</b> - the fraction of annotated synthetic variants that are identified within the library.
    For example, if only 7, of 10 known variants are detected, the sensitivity will equal 0.7.  
    <b>Precision</b> - the fraction of correctly identified (or true positive) variants. This provides a measure
    of identification accuracy. For example, if 10 variants are identified, but 4 do not exist (and were mistakenly
    identified from sequencing errors) we would have a precision of 0.6.
    <b>Correlation</b> - indicates the accuracy for measuring allele frequency across a range of input concentrations.
    <b>Slope</b> - indicates the quantitative linearity of allele frequency measures.
    <b>Coefficient of determination (R2)</b> - indicates the amount of variation that can be accounted for by the linear model.

    VarSomatic can also be used to assess the diagnostic performance for variant identification with receiver operating
    characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC).

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    VarSomatic requires standard VCF file that is generated by common variant calling software, such as Strelka.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarSomatic –rbed reference.bed –rvcf reference.vcf –usample sample.vcf -usequin sequins.vcf

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rvcf        Reference variant annotation file in VCF format
        -rbed        Reference <i>in silico</i> coordinate annotation file in BED format
        -usequin     User-generated somatic variants for sequin-derived in VCF format

     Optional:
        -o = output    Directory in which the output files are written to
        -edge = 0      Edge effects width in nucleotide bases
        -usample       User-generated somatic variants for sample-derived in VCF format
        -method = all  Should only the filtered variants ("PASS" in VCF) be considered? Possible values are "pass" and "all".
