VarQuin Analysis                     Anaquin Manual                    

NAME
	 VarFrequency -
	  Assess quantitative analysis of variant allele frequencies.

DESCRIPTION
	 VarFrequency can be used to analyse the measured synthetic variant allele frequency. Comparing the measured allele frequency
	 (typically expressed as a fraction), relative to the known frequency for synthetic variants enables an assessment of sensitivity and quantitative accuracy.

	 Specifically, VarFrequency builds a linear model relating the measured allele frequency (dependent variable) to the input concentration (independent variable)
	 defined by a mixture. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to estimate the regression parameters, including:

	   Correlation      – indicates the accuracy for measuring allele frequency across a range of input concentrations. 
       Sensitivity      - indicates the quantitative linearity of allele frequency measures.
       Coefficient (R2) – indicates the amount of variation that can be accounted for by the linear model.

BIOINFORMATICS SOFTWARE
	 VarFrequency take the standard VCF file that is provided by popular variant identification software, such as GATK. Please note that VarFrequency requires a
	 quantitative measurement of allele frequency, such as provided by the AF flag in the VCF file format. VarFrequency also supports custom text output format.

INPUTS
	 Reference variant file in VCF format
	 Reference VarQuin mixture file in CSV format	 
	 Generated variant file in VCF or text format

USAGE EXAMPLE
	Example of VCF input:
	anaquin VarFrequency –m mixture.csv –rvcf reference.vcf –ufiles variants.vcf

	Example of VarScan input:
	anaquin VarFrequency –m mixture.csv –rvcf reference.vcf –ufiles variants.txt

TOOL OPTIONS
