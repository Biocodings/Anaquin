<b>NAME</b>
     VarGermline - Assess the identification of variants from alignments to the <i>in silico</i> genome

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarGermline can be used for analyzing the identification of variants and quantifying synthetic variant
    allele frequency on the <i>in silico</i> genome, and provides several useful statistics to describe the
    identification of variants, including:
    
    <b>Sensitivity</b> - the fraction of annotated synthetic variants that are identified within the library.
    For example, if only 7, of 10 known variants are detected, the sensitivity will equal 0.7.  
    <b>Precision</b> - the fraction of correctly identified (or true positive) variants. This provides a measure
    of identification accuracy. For example, if 10 variants are identified, but 4 do not exist (and were mistakenly
    identified from sequencing errors) we would have a precision of 0.6.
    <b>Correlation</b> - indicates the accuracy for measuring allele frequency across a range of input concentrations.
    <b>Slope</b> - indicates the quantitative linearity of allele frequency measures.
    <b>Coefficient of determination (R2)</b> - indicates the amount of variation that can be accounted for by the linear model.

    VarGermline can also be used to assess the diagnostic performance for variant identification with receiver operating
    characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC).
    
    The tool is also useful for comparing the measured allele frequency (typically expressed as a fraction), relative to
    the known frequency for synthetic variants enables an assessment of sensitivity and quantitative accuracy. Specifically, 
    VarGermline builds a linear model relating the measured allele frequency (dependent variable) to the input concentration 
    (independent variable) defined by a mixture. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to estimate the regression parameters.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    VarGermline requires standard VCF files that is generated by common variant calling software, such as Genome Analysis
    Toolkit (GATK).
