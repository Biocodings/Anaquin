<b>NAME</b>
    MetaAssembly - Compares assembled contigs to sequin annotations in the in silico community.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    MetaAssembly quantifies performance of de novo assembly to known synthetic sequins in the in silico community.
    The tool provides the following statistics:     
       
       Contig length – N20, N25, N80
       Accuracy      - number of bases matched, number of bases mismatched
       Sensitivity   – fraction of nucleotide bases relative to the reference assembled. 

    The tool also builds a logistic regression model between input concentration and sensitivity for sequins.
   
<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    Any de novo assembler able to generate FASTA outputs. Alignment for the contigs must be done by Blat.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin MetaAssembly -rmix reference.csv -rbed reference.bed -usequin contigs.fasta -usequin align.psl

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rbed        Reference annotation file in BED format
        -usequin     Generated contigs in FASTA format
        -usequin     Generated Blat alignment in PSL format    

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to
        -mix = A     Mixture A or B?

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     MetaAssembly_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     MetaAssembly_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
     MetaAssembly_assembly.R    - R-script for building a logistic model between sensitivity and input concentration
