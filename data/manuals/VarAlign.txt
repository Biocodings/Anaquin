<b>NAME</b>
    VarAlign - Measures the read alignment from sequins to the <i>in silico</i> genome.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarAlign calculates several useful statistics from an alignment file.

    <b>Dilution</b> - the fraction of reads the align to the <i>in silico</i> genome relative to the accompanying reference genome.
    <b>Sensitivity</b> - the fraction of annotated regions covered by alignments. For example, a sequin of length 1000nt, of which 500nt have reads aligned, would have a sensitivity of 0.5. 
    <b>Precision</b> - the fraction of annotated regions that are covered by alignments, relative to total regions of alignments. This indicates the accuracy of alignments. For example, if 1000nt of alignments overlap with only 500nt annotated regions, this will have a specificity of 0.5.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Short-read aligner (such as BWA or BowTie) that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarAlign –rbed reference.bed –uhuman humans.bam -useqs sequins.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rbed        Reference annotation file for sequin regions in BED format
        -uhuman      Generated alignment file for human genome in SAM/BAM format
        -useqs       Generated alignment file for <i>in silico</i> genome in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarAlign_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     VarAlign_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
