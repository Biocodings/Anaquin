<b>NAME</b>
    VarAlign - Assess the alignment of sample- and sequin derived reads to sequin regions.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarAlign calculates several useful statistics from an alignment file.

    <b>Dilution</b> - fraction of reads that align to the chiral genome relative to the accompanying reference genome (eg. Hg38). 
    <b>Sensitivity</b> - fraction of regions covered by sample- and sequin-alignments. For example, a sequin of length 1000nt, of which 500nt have reads aligned, would have a sensitivity of 0.5. 
    <b>Precision</b> - fraction of regions that are covered by alignments relative to total regions of alignments. This indicates the accuracy of alignments. For example, if 1000nt of alignments overlap with only 500nt annotated regions, this will have a precision of 0.5.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Short-read aligner (such as BWA or BowTie) that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarAlign –rbed reference.bed –usample sample.bam -usequin sequins.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -usequin     User generated sequin-derived alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -rbed        Reference annotation file for sequin regions in BED format
        -usample     User generated sample-derived alignment file in SAM/BAM format
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to
        -edge = 550  Edge effects width in nucleotide bases

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarAlign_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     VarAlign_sequins.tsv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
     VarAlign_stats.json    - gives the JSON file for the statistics
