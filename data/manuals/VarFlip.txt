<b>Anaquin Manual</b>

<b>NAME</b>
    VarAlign - Measures the read alignment from sequins to the in silico chromosome.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarAlign calculates several useful statistics to describe alignment performance, including:
    a) Dilution factor indicates fraction of reads that align to the in silico chromosome, relative to the accompanying  genome. 
    b) Sensitivity indicates the fraction of annotated regions covered by alignments. 
    c) Precision indicates the accuracy of alignments.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Short-read aligner that generates a SAM/BAM alignment file, including popular examples such as BWA and Bowtie.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin –t VarAlign –rbed reference.bed –ufiles aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rbed        Reference annotation file in BED format
        -ufiles      User-generated alignment files in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarAlign_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     VarAlign_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
