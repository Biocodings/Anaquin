<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
    VarFlip - Extracts forward paired-end reads from alignments to the <i>in silico</i> genome.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarFlip first extracts alignments to the <i>in silico</i> genome, determine their reverse sequence
    and generates a new set of paired-end library files (.FASTQ). This new set of reads constitute
    sequin-derived reads that have been mirrored to the orientation of the human genome.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     VarFlip takes the standard SAM/BAM file.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarFlip â€“ufiles aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -ufiles      Generated forward/reverse alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarFlip_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     VarFlip_paired_1.fq   - is the first paired-end sequence file with reads from inputs aligned to the <i>in silico</i> genome.
     VarFlip_paired_2.fq   - is the second paired-end for VarFlip_paired_1.fq.
     VarFlip_crossed_1.fq  - is the first paired-end sequence file with reads from inputs aligned to both the human and the <i>in-silico</i> genome.
     VarFlip_crossed_2.fq  - is the second paired-end for VarFlip_crossed_1.fq.
     VarFlip_hanging.fq    - gives hanging paired-end reads aligned to the <i>in silico</i> genome.
