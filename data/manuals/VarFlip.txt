<b>NAME</b>
    VarFlip - Compute reverse complement of sequin alignments to the reverse genome.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarFlip is designed to compute reverse complement of sequin reads aligned to the reverse
    synthetic genome. It takes raw sequence files and its alignment files for inputs. The tool
    extracts all reads aligned to the reverse genome, compute their reverse complement and generate
    a new set of pair-ended sequence files for the sequin reads.

    Filters can be applied to filter our low quality reads aligned to the reverse genome. Users are
    expected to realign the generated sequin pair-ended sequence files against the human genome.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     VarFlip takes the standard SAM/BAM file that is supported by all popular alignment softwares.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarFlip –ufiles seq_1.fq –ufiles seq_2.fq –ufiles aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -ufiles      First pair for the input sequence file in FASTQ format
        -ufiles      Second pair for the input sequence file in FASTQ format
        -ufiles      Generated forward/reverse  alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarFlip_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
