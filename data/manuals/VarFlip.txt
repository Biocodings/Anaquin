<b>NAME</b>
    VarFlip - Compute reverse complement of sequin alignments to the reverse genome.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarFlip is designed to compute reverse complement of sequin reads aligned to the reverse
    synthetic genome. The tool extracts all reads aligned to the reverse genome, compute their
    reverse complement and generate a new set of pair-ended sequence files for the sequin reads.

s<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     VarFlip takes the standard SAM/BAM file that is supported by all popular alignment softwares.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarFlip â€“ufiles aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -ufiles      Generated forward/reverse  alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarFlip_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     VarFlip_sequins.1.fq  - is the first paired-end sequence file with reads from the inputs that
                             are aligned to reverse genome.
     VarFlip_sequins.2.fq  - is the second paired-end for VarFlip_sequins_1.fq
