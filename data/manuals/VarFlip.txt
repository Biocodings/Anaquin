<b>NAME</b>
    VarFlip - Extracts forward paired-end reads from alignments to the <i>in silico</i> genome.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarFlip extracts alignments to the <i>in silico</i> genome, determines their reverse sequence
    and generates a new set of paired-end library files (.FASTQ). This new set of reads constitute
    sequin-derived reads that have been mirrored to the orientation of the human genome.

    This tool also generates ambiguous reads. A paired-read is ambiguous if:
    
        - Either or both mate mapped to the forward human genome (e.g. not "chrev1" but "chr1")
        - Both mates are unmapped

    Hanging reads are reads that one of the mates is missing in the input alignment file.

    Please note single-ended reads is not supported.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     VarFlip takes the standard SAM/BAM file.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarFlip â€“ubam aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -ubam        Generated forward/reverse alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

     VarFlip_flipped_2.fq   - is the second paired-end for VarFlip_flipped_1.fq.
     VarFlip_ambiguous_1.fq - is the first paired-end sequence file for ambigious reads
     VarFlip_ambiguous_2.fq - is the second paired-end for VarFlip_ambig_1.fq
     VarFlip_hanging.fq     - is the paired-end sequence file for hanging reads
