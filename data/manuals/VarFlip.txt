<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
    VarFlip - Flip sequin-derived reads from chiral (3’ to 5’) to human genome (5’ to 3’) orientation.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarFlip will reverse the sequence (and quality scores) of sequin-derived reads. This generates a
    generates a new set of paired-end library files (.FASTQ) that are orientated in the same direction as
    the human genome. This tool will also omit any alignments that are ambiguous (eg. if either mate pair
    does not align, or aligns to the reference genome). Please note single-ended reads is not supported.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     VarFlip supports the standard SAM/BAM file.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarFlip –usequin aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -usequin     Generated forward/reverse alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarFlip_summary.stats  - provides the summary statistics
     VarFlip_flipped_1.fq   - is the first paired-end sequence file for flipped reads
     VarFlip_flipped_2.fq   - is the second paired-end for VarFlip_flipped_1.fq
     VarFlip_ambiguous_1.fq - is the first paired-end sequence file for ambiguous reads
     VarFlip_ambiguous_2.fq - is the second paired-end for VarFlip_ambig_1.fq
     VarFlip_hanging.fq     - is the sequence file for hanging reads
