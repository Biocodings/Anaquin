<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL

<b>NAME</b>
     VarMutation - Compare the identification of variants from sequin- and sample-derived alignments.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarMutation can be used to compare variant detection between sequin-
    and sample-derived alignments, and also compare the detection of sequin variants to a known
    reference annotation of represented variants. This comparison provides several useful statistics
    to describe the identification of variants, including:
    
    <b>Sensitivity</b> - the fraction of annotated synthetic variants that are identified within the library.
    For example, if only 7, of 10 known variants are detected, the sensitivity will equal 0.7.  
    <b>Precision</b> - the fraction of correctly identified (or true positive) variants. This provides a measure
    of identification accuracy. For example, if 10 variants are identified, but 4 do not exist (and were mistakenly
    identified from sequencing errors) we would have a precision of 0.6.

    VarMutation can also be used to assess the diagnostic performance for variant identification with receiver operating
    characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC).
    
<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    VarMutation requires standard VCF file that is generated by most variant calling softwares, such as Genome Analysis
    Toolkit (GATK).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarMutation -method germline -usequin variants.vcf
     anaquin VarMutation -method somatic -usequin variants.vcf   

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -usequin       User generated sequin-derived variants (.VCF)
        -method        Germline analysis or somatic analysis? Possible values are "germline" and "somatic".

     Optional:
        -o = output    Directory in which the output files are written to
        -rvcf          Reference annotation file for all variants represented with sequins (.VCF)
        -rbed          Reference sequins coordinate annotation file (.BED)
        -ubed          Reference custom sequins coordinate annotation file (.BED)
        -edge = 550    Edge effects width in nucleotide bases
        -usample       User generated sample-derived variants (.VCF)
        -filter = all  Should only the filtered variants ("PASS" in VCF) be considered? Possible values are "pass" and "all".
