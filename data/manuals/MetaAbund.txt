<b>NAME</b>
    MetaAbund - Quantitative analysis of sequin abundance.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    MetaAbund can be used for analyzing sequin abundance within a library. Comparing the measured abundance
    relative to the known input concentrations provides an indication of the quantitative accuracy for measuring species.
    
    Specifically, MetaAbund builds a linear model regressing the measured expression (dependent variable) with the input
    concentration (independent variable; defined by the mixture). Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to estimate
    the regression parameters, including:
    
       Correlation – provides a measure of quantitative accuracy across a range of input concentrations.
       Slope – indicates the quantitative linearity for gene expression measures.
       Coefficient of determination (R2) – indicates the amount of variation that can be accounted for by the linear model.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     MetaAbund is compatible with short-read aligners, including: BWA and Bowtie. In addition, the tool can be used in R
     for data visualization.
     
     Furthermore, the tool can be used for quantifying k-mer abundance. The current release supports RayMeta, future
     releases will add new softwares.
     
     Users of alternative software may need to modify their results to conform with file formats produced by these popular
     software tools, before provision to the tool.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     Measure abundance by alignment:

         anaquin MetaAbund -rmix reference.csv -usequin align.bam
     
     Measure abundance by de-novo assembly:

         anaquin MetaAbund -rmix reference.csv -usequin contigs.tsv -usequin align.psl

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rmix        Reference mixture file in CSV format
        -usequin     The tool supports quantification by alignment or de novo assmebly. The usage example describes the
                     two scenarios. 

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which output files are written to
        -mix = A     Mixture A or B?

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     MetaAbund_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
     MetaAbund_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
