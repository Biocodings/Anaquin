<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
    VarKAbund - Quantitative analysis for k-mer sequin abundance.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     VarKAbund can be used for analyzing the k-mer abundance within a genomic library spiked with sequins.
     Comparing the measured abundance relative to the known input concentrations provides
     an indication of the quantitative accuracy for the experiment.
     
     This tool works on the conjoint ladder, allele frequency ladder and copy number ladder.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     Kallisto (https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto)
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     Quantify for the conjoint ladder:

         anaquin VKAbund –ucon reference.csv -usequin quant.sf

     Quantify for the copy number ladder:
     
         anaquin VKAbund –ucnv reference.csv -usequin quant.sf
     
     Quantify for the allele frequency ladder:
     
         anaquin VKAbund –uaf reference.csv -usequin quant.sf

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -ucon or -ucnv or -uaf  Reference mixture for one of the ladders; conjoint, copy number or allele frequency.
        -usequin                Generated Salmon quantification file

     Optional:
        -o = output             Directory in which output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     VarKAbund_summary.stats - provides global summary statistics for sequin abundance
     VarKAbund_sequins.csv   - provides detailed statistics for each individual sequin
     VarKAbund_linear.R      - provides R-script for plotting a linear model between measured abundance (dependent variable)
                               and input concentration (independent variable) on the logarithm scale
