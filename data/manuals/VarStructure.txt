<b>NAME</b>
    VarStructure - Compare the identification of structural variants from sequin- and sample-derived alignments.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarStructure can be used to compare structural variants between sequin- and sample-derived
    alignments, and also compare the detection of sequin structual variants to a known reference annotation of
    represented variants. This comparison provides several useful statistics to describe the identification of variants,
    including:
    
    <b>Sensitivity</b> - the fraction of annotated synthetic variants that are identified within the library.
    For example, if only 7, of 10 known variants are detected, the sensitivity will equal 0.7.  
    <b>Precision</b> - the fraction of correctly identified (or true positive) variants. This provides a measure
    of identification accuracy. For example, if 10 variants are identified, but 4 do not exist (and were mistakenly
    identified from sequencing errors) we would have a precision of 0.6.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    VarStructure requires standard VCF 4.2 structural variant file.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
    anaquin VarStructure -rvcf reference.vcf -rbed reference.bed -usequin variants.vcf

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
    Required:
        -rvcf        Reference annotation file for all variants represented with sequins (.VCF)
        -rbed        Reference chiral coordinate annotation file (.BED)
        -usequin     User generated sequin-derived variants (.VCF)

    Optional:
        -usample     User generated sample-derived variants (.VCF)
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to
        -edge = 0       Egde effects width in nucleotide bases
