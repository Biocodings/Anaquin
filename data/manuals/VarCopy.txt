<b>NAME</b>
     VarCopy - Assess the identification of variants from alignments to the <i>in silico</i> genome for WGS sequins

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarCopy can be used for analyzing the identification of variants and quantifying synthetic variant
    allele frequency on the <i>in silico</i> genome, and provides several useful statistics to describe the
    identification of variants, including:
    
    <b>Sensitivity</b> - the fraction of annotated synthetic variants that are identified within the library.
    For example, if only 7, of 10 known variants are detected, the sensitivity will equal 0.7.  
    <b>Precision</b> - the fraction of correctly identified (or true positive) variants. This provides a measure
    of identification accuracy. For example, if 10 variants are identified, but 4 do not exist (and were mistakenly
    identified from sequencing errors) we would have a precision of 0.6.
    <b>Correlation</b> - indicates the accuracy for measuring allele frequency across a range of input concentrations.
    <b>Slope</b> - indicates the quantitative linearity of allele frequency measures.
    <b>Coefficient of determination (R2)</b> - indicates the amount of variation that can be accounted for by the linear model.

    VarCopy can also be used to assess the diagnostic performance for variant identification with receiver operating
    characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC).
    
<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    VarCopy requires standard VCF file that is generated by most variant calling softwares, such as Genome Analysis
    Toolkit (GATK).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarCopy -rvcf reference.vcf -rbed reference.bed -usequin variants.vcf

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:

        -usequin     User-generated sequin-derived variants in VCF format

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to
