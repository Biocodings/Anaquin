<b>NAME</b>
     VarCopy - Perform quantitative analysis on copy number variation

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarCopy is designed to quantify the accuracy of copy number ladder within a genomic library spiked with
    sequins. Building a linear model between measured coverage relative to the known copy number provides an
    indication of the quantitative accuracy for the experiment.

    Furthermore, the tool calibrates the input sequin-derived alignment file against the sample-derived
    alignment file. The calibrated reads are given in the console.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    Any short-read aligners such as BWA.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarCopy –cnv reference.csv –rbed reference.bed –method mean –usample sample.bam -usequin sequin.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -cnv            Reference mixture file for the CNV ladder in CSV format
        -rbed           Reference sequin regions annotation file in BED format
        -usample        User generated sample-derived alignment file in SAM/BAM format
        -usequin        User generated sequin-derived alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -method = mean  Algorithm used to calculate sequence coverage. Possible values include mean, median, reads,
                        x (where x is the fraction of reads aligned to <i>in silico</i> to subsample. For example, 0.01 is 1%, 0.10
                        is 10% etc.)
        -o = output     Directory in which the output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
    VarCopy_summary.stats - gives the summary statistics
    VarCopy_sequins.csv   - gives detailed statistics for each sequin
    VarCopy_linear.csv    - gives R-script for plotting a linear model between measured coverage (dependent variable) and expected
                            copy number (independent variable)
