<b>NAME</b>
     RnaExpression - Quantitative analysis of RNA sequin expression.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     RnaExpression can be used for analyzing the RNA sequin gene / isoform expression within a library.
     Comparing the measured expression (typically in FPKM) relative to the known input concentrations provides
     an indication of the quantitative accuracy for measuring gene expression. RnaExpression can accept both 
     single replicate or multiple replicate libraries. If multiple libraries are provided, RnaExpression will
     report statistics with standard deviation indicated.  

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     RnaExpression is compatible with many common tools for analysing gene expression tools, including Cufflinks, StringTie
     and Kallisto. In addition, RnaExpression can be used in R and is compatible with edgeR, DESeq2. Users of
     alternative software may need to modify their results to conform with file formats produced by these popular
     software tools.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     For single replicate:
     anaquin RnaExpression –rmix mixture.csv –usequin sample1.gtf

     For multiple replicates:
     anaquin RnaExpression –rmix mixture.csv –usequin sample1.gtf –usequin sample2.gtf –usequin sample3.gtf

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -rmix        Reference VarQuin mixture file in CSV format
        -usequin     User-generated expression file in GTF format or custom text format.
                     Please refer to users guide for details on custom text format.

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to
        -mix = A     Mixture A or B?

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     RnaExpression_summary.stats - provides global summary statistics for sequin expression
     RnaExpression_isoforms.csv  - provides detailed statistics for each individual sequin isoform
     RnaExpression_genes.csv     - provides detailed statistics for each individual sequin gene
     RnaExpression_isoforms.R    - provides R-script for plotting a linear model for isoform expression between expression level
                                   (dependent variable) and input concentration (independent variable) on the logarithm scale
     RnaExpression_genes.R       - provides R-script for plotting a linear model for gene expression between expression level
                                   (dependent variable) and input concentration (independent variable) on the logarithm scale
