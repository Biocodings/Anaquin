<b>NAME</b>
     RnaExpression - Quantitative analysis of RNA sequin expression.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
     RnaExpression can be used for analyzing the RNA sequin gene / isoform expression within a library.
     Comparing the measured expression (typically in FPKM) relative to the known input concentrations provides
     an indication of the quantitative accuracy for measuring gene expression. RnaExpression can accept both 
     single replicate or multiple replicate libraries. If multiple libraries are provided, RnaExpression will
     report statistics with standard deviation indicated.  

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     RnaExpression is compatible with many common tools for analysing gene expression tools, including Cufflinks, StringTie
     and Kallisto. In addition, RnaExpression can be used in R and is compatible with edgeR, DESeq2. Users of
     alternative software may need to modify their results to conform with file formats produced by these popular
     software tools.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     For single replicate:
     anaquin RnaExpression –m mixture.csv –ufiles sample1.gtf

     For multiple replicates:
     anaquin RnaExpression –m mixture.csv –ufiles sample1.gtf –ufiles sample2.gtf –ufiles sample3.gtf

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -m           Reference VarQuin mixture file in CSV format
        -method      Whether the analysis should be performed at "gene" or "isoform" level.
        -ufiles      User-generated expression file in GTF format or custom text format.
                     Please refer to users guide for details on custom text format.

     Optional:
        -o = output  Directory in which the output files are written to

<b>OUTPUTS</b>
     RnaExpression_summary.stats - provides global summary statistics for sequin expression
     RnaExpress_sequins.csv      - provides detailed statistics for each individual sequin
     RnaExpress_linear.R         - provides R-script for plotting a linear model between expression level (dependent variable)
                                   and input concentration (independent variable) on the logarithm scale
