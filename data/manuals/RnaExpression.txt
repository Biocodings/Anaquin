NAME
	 RnaExpression - Quantitative analysis of sequin expression.

DESCRIPTION
	 RnaExpression can be used for analyzing the gene or isoform expression of RNA sequins within a library. Comparing the measured expression (typically in FPKM)
	 relative to the known input concentrations provides an indication of the quantitative accuracy for measuring gene expression.

	 Specifically, RnaExpression builds a linear model regressing the measured expression (dependent variable) with the input concentration (independent variable;
	 defined by the mixture). Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to estimate the regression parameters, including:

	   Correlation      – provides a measure of quantitative accuracy across a range of input concentrations. 

       Slope            - indicates the quantitative linearity for gene expression measures.

       Coefficient (R2) – indicates the amount of variation that can be accounted for by the linear model.
	   
	 RnaExpression can accept both single replicate or multiple replicate libraries. If multiple libraries are provided, RnaExpression will report statistics with
	 standard deviation indicated.  

BIOINFORMATICS SOFTWARE
	 RnaExpression is compatible with many popular gene expression tools, including: Cufflinks, StringTie and Kallisto. In addition, RnaExpression can be used in R
	 and is compatible with edgeR, DESeq2. Users of alternative software may need to modify their results to conform with file formats produced by these popular
	 software tools, before provision to the tool.

INPUTS
	 Reference RnaQuin mixgture file in CSV format
	 Generated expression file in GTF format or text format
