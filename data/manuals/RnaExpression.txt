NAME
     RnaExpression - Quantitative analysis of sequin expression

DESCRIPTION
     RnaExpression can be used for analyzing the gene or isoform expression of RNA sequins within a library.
     Comparing the measured expression (typically in FPKM) relative to the known input concentrations provides
     an indication of the quantitative accuracy for measuring gene expression.

     Specifically, RnaExpression builds a linear model regressing the measured expression (dependent variable)
     with the input concentration (independent variable; defined by the mixture). Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
     is used to estimate the regression parameters, including:

       Correlation      – provides a measure of quantitative accuracy across a range of input concentrations. 

       Slope            - indicates the quantitative linearity for gene expression measures.

       Coefficient (R2) – indicates the amount of variation that can be accounted for by the linear model.
       
     RnaExpression can accept both single replicate or multiple replicate libraries. If multiple libraries are
     provided, RnaExpression will report statistics with standard deviation indicated.  

BIOINFORMATICS SOFTWARE
     RnaExpression is compatible with many popular gene expression tools, including: Cufflinks, StringTie and
     Kallisto. In addition, RnaExpression can be used in R and is compatible with edgeR, DESeq2. Users of
     alternative software may need to modify their results to conform with file formats produced by these popular
     software tools, before provision to the tool.
