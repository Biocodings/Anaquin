<b>ANAQUIN MANUAL</b>

<b>NAME</b>
    VarPartition - Perform flipping, trimming, splitting and calibration on sequin- and sample-derived alignments.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    Workflow in three steps:

    1. Sequin alignments give artificials near the region boundaries. This step trims those reads.
    2. Alignment subsampling is a simple and effective method for calibrating the sequence coverage of sequins
       to accompanying human genome sample. The second step calculates the alignment coverage within specified regions,
       and scales sequin coverage in corresponding regions accordingly. 
    3. Reverse the sequence (and quality scores) of sequin-derived reads.
    
    This tool generates a new set of paired-end library files (.FASTQ) that are orientated in the same direction as
    the human genome. This tool will also omit any alignments that are ambiguous (eg. if either mate pair
    does not align, or aligns to the reference genome). Please note single-ended reads is not supported.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
     VarPartition supports standard SAM/BAM file.
     
<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarPartition â€“usequin aligned.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
        -usequin        Generated forward/reverse alignment file in SAM/BAM format

     Optional:
        -o = output     Directory in which output files are written to
        -rbed           Annotation file (BED format) of sequin regions
        -ubed           Reference custom sequins coordinate annotation file (.BED)
        -edge = 550     Edge effects width in nucleotide bases
        -trim = 2       How many nucletide bases from the sequin boundaries for trimming 
        --writeUncalib  Write out trimmed but uncalibrated reads to the reverse genome?
