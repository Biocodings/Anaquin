<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    VarConjoint can be used for analyzing the conjoint sequins within a library. Comparing the measured
    abundance (typically in counts) relative to the known input concentration provides an indication of
    the quantitative accuracy for measuring copy number.

<b>SUPPORT SOFTWARE</b>
    Any short-read aligners such as BWA.

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
     anaquin VarConjoint â€“con reference.csv -usequin sequin.bam

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
     Required:
