            Execute the following data analysis tool:
            
            RnaAlign      - Measure the spliced read alignments from sequins to the in silico chromosome
            RnaAssembly   - Compare assembled transcript models to sequin annotations in the in silico chromosome
            RnaExpression - Quantitative analysis of sequin expression
            RnaFoldChange - Assess fold-changes in gene expression between multiple samples
            RnaSubsample  - Calibrate the sequence coverage of sequins across multiple replicates
            
            VarAlign      - Measure the read alignment from sequins to the in silico chromosome
            VarSubsample  - Calibrate the sequence coverage of sequins to accompanying human genome
            VarDiscover   - Assesses the identification of variants from alignments to the in silico chromosome
