Introduction
---

An accurate quantification of variability in RNA sequencing analysis is critical for bioinformatics analysis. To control for these sources of variabiltiy, Garvan Institute of Medical Research has developed a set of spiked-in synthetic sequins known as TransQuin. The sequins emulate a diverse range of genomic features and they are combined together across a range of concentration to formulate a mixture to emulate quantitative features.
Anaquin is the statistical software toolkit built for TransQuin. It is designed to analyze outputs generated by the NGS tools, and accommodates the analysis with detailed statistics on the sequins. Please refer to www.sequin.xyz for more details.
