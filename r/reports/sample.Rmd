# Read Alignment

```{r eval=FALSE}
Summary for dataset: K_RMXA1v2.accepted_hits.sorted.bam

   Unmapped:   0 reads
   Experiment: 36484961 reads
   Synthetic:  11440146 reads

   Reference:  1190 exons
   Reference:  1028 introns
   Reference:  149219 bases

   Query:      84739030 exons
   Query:      27056077 introns
   Query:      153438 bases

   Dilution:   0.238709

   ***
   *** The following statistics are computed at the exon, intron and base level.
   ***
   *** Exon level is defined by performance per exon. An alignment that
   *** is not mapped entirely within an exon is considered as a FP. The
   *** intron level is similar.
   ***
   *** Base level is defined by performance per nucleotide. A partial
   *** mapped read will have FP and TP.
