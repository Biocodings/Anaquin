When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
a <- data.frame(x=c(1:10),y=2*c(1:10))
a
```



Summary for dataset: ABCD.sam  

   Unmapped:  0 reads  
   Experiment:    997 reads
   Synthetic: 0 reads

   Reference: 1190 exons
   Reference: 1028 introns
   Reference: 149219 bases

   Query: 2138 exons
   Query: 1140 introns
   Query: 0 bases
   
   
   

Table Header  | Second Header
 ------------- | -------------
 Table Cell    | Cell 2
 Cell 3        | Cell 4

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
